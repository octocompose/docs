OctoCompose will be a lightweight yet powerful tool for microservice orchestration that works across baremetal, Docker, and Kubernetes environments.

It helps you deploy, manage, and monitor multiple software services as a unified system. It serves as the conductor for your microservice orchestra, making sure everything starts in the right order and works together harmoniously.
