  About the Name and Logo
---

## Project Name Origin

The name `OctoCompose` is a deliberate fusion of "Octopus" and "Compose," reflecting both the multi-service orchestration capabilities (like an octopus's many arms) and the compositional nature of the configuration system.

### Name Selection Process

Finding an appropriate name for this project was challenging. We explored several alternatives including `octctl`, `orbctl`, and `orberator` before settling on `OctoCompose`. The selection process involved ensuring:

- Domain name availability
- No namespace conflicts on GitHub and other platforms
- Alignment with the project's core functionality

## Logo Evolution

### Current Logo

Our current logo was sourced from [FreeLogoDesign](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) and features an octopus with containers, symbolizing the project's purpose:

### Design Considerations

We later noticed a visual similarity with Docker Compose's logo:

![Docker Compose Logo](https://superset.apache.org/img/docker-compose.webp)

While this similarity was unintentional, it highlights our shared focus on service composition and orchestration.

### Logo Roadmap

We're open to evolving our visual identity as the project matures. If you have design expertise or suggestions for improving our logo while maintaining the core octopus/composition theme, we welcome your contributions.
