  About the Name and Logo
---

`OctoCompose` is a combination/mixture of `Octopus` and `docker-compose`.

### Complications while finding a name

I found it very hard to find a good name for this tool, while writing this concept doc I changed the name multiple times.

There are either no free Domain Names, no Github or other clashes.

I'm still not sure this is the right name. Previous names have been `octctl`, `orbctl` and `orberator`.

## Logo

I bought that Logo from [FreeLogoDesign](https://www.freelogodesign.org/), it's a Octopus with boxes. 

### FreeLogoDesign one

### Similarity to Docker Compose

Sadly it looks like Docker Compose I found after:

### Help wanted

I'm still not satisfied with the logo, so if you have a better idea or want to help me find a better one, please let me know.
