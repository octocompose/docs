`OctoCompose` is a combination/mixture of `Octopus` and `docker-compose`.

## Complications while finding a name

I found it very hard to find a good name for this tool, while writing this concept doc I changed the name multiple times.

There are either no free Domain Names, no Github or other clashes.

I'm still not sure this is the right name. Previous names have been `octctl`, `orbctl` and `orberator`.
