## Quick Overview

OctoCompose helps you deploy, manage, and monitor multiple software services as a unified system. It serves as the conductor for your microservice orchestra, making sure everything starts in the right order and works together harmoniously.

Unlike traditional orchestration tools that lock you into a specific environment, OctoCompose works the same way whether you're running on bare metal, Docker containers, or Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Features

- **Environment Agnostic**: Run the same configuration in baremetal, Docker, or Kubernetes
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible design keeps the core lightweight
- **Powerful Configuration**: Advanced config merging from multiple sources with templating
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks with notification capabilities
- **Version Management**: Track and manage versions for smooth upgrades
- **Secret Management**: Securely handle sensitive information

## Project Status

OctoCompose is currently in concept phase. The core architecture and plugin system are being designed, with initial implementations focused on the baremetal operator.
